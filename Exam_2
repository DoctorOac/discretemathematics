"""Develop a program that randomly selects a total charge. 
Then randomly select a payment in dollars and cents that exceeds that charge.
Then have the program calculate the change in pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, ones, fives, and 
twenties. 
Bonus points for anyone who writes a program that can "Count change back."""
